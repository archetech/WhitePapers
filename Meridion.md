Elevator Pitch

Open Capital is like Open Source for Value

Open Capital = Meridion + Cherubim + Nomicon + Magenta (Javien)

open source github for value creation projects

Uberize savings and loan, charities, investement funds, companies, everything that create Value

All open source software running on blockchain

Accounts and Projects

Each account can create as many Projects as they like
Each account can own shares of as many Projects as they can earn
Each account can be a member of any number of Projects in any number of roles

A project can be a personal or a group effort
A project can be a charity, company, NGO, club, society, kickstarter, online community, web site, brand, artist collective, intentional community, anything you can envision.
Each project is created with 1 million pre-mined tokens representing ownership.

Each project has associated digital assets

	* support software
	* cryptographic key pair
	* unique ID (hash of public key)
	* governance system (nom for Nomicon)
	* controlled documents (src for source)
	* generated files (dst for distribution)
	* published documents (pub for publications)
	* any number of crypto-currency wallets
	* any number of sub-projects


All digital assets are managed in a git compository (hierarchical repository)

The project evolves according to its unique Nomicon
The Nomicon and support software are included in src and dst and pub
The Nomicon configures the support software to enforce rules on how the digital assets are modified over time (based on review-oriented software development methodology) using smart contracts that use ownership tokens for revision approval voting

All value exchanges are through smart contracts so taxation is impossible because both parties must sign the contract

Theft is possible due to coding errors (e.g ICO thefts)
Coercion is possible outside the system that can affect transactions inside, but the point is coercion is not possible endogenously
